* Jarboe

Jarboe is a vi inspired ncurses note taking application.

** Build instructions

Ncurses, and grapheme are required libraries. Install ncurses via a package manager, grapheme is already included in the source.

Arch:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S ncurses
#+END_SRC
Fedora:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel
#+END_SRC

To build, go to the directory of the source and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
#+END_SRC

To install the program globally to your machine, run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Cli arguments:
Use -h to print the help screen.
Use -w to avoid rendering the ncurses interface and issue commands to jarboe directly instead.
