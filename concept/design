note taking program

this will be designed for quickly jotting down notes without much regard for organization at the time


there will be an ncurses screen for note taking with evil keybinds like vim
there should be a command line where you can do things like add tags to your notes, combine it with other notes, add it to collections etc
there should also be a menu that lets you search for notes by tags and collections.
it should automatically format notes to a certain extent
i will create my own file type for the notes to hold some amount of metadata (tags, creation dates, etc)
there should also be a command to package collections, or all notes, into one file that can be easily shared between devices



commands:

:q quit
:w write
:wq write quit
:o open file (type name)
:sc search collection for phrase
:sn search current file for phrase (grep or ripgrep)
:stc search collection for tag
:sta search all for tag
:ac add to collection
:at add tag
:ec export collection
:ea export all
:pll pull from remote server
:psh push to remote server
